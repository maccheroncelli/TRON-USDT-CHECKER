# USDT - TRON TRC20 Checker

## Overview
The USDT - TRON TRC20 Checker is an advanced desktop tool for analyzing USDT transactions on the TRON network. Featuring a robust GUI developed with PyQt5, it extends its functionality to include attribution of transactions to known exchange hot wallets and direct Tronscan access for address details.

## Minimum Requirements

   pip install PyQt5 requests sqlite3
   ```
   
3. Clone the repository or download both 'tron_usdt_checker.py' **and** 'db_view_update.py'.
4. The Database file (Optional) comes pre-filled with Binance TRON/USDT Hotwallets as of '01/14/2024'.  This file will be created upon first run regardless.
5. Run 'tron_usdt_checker.py' using Python.

## Hot Wallets - Additional Resources
- To find out the specific Hot Wallets that exchanges use and potentially include them into the Database, visit CoinMarketCap's [Proof of Reserves](https://coinmarketcap.com/academy/article/cmc-launches-proof-of-reserves) and [Exchange Rankings](https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/) pages.  All the information you require is there...

## Limitations
- Restricted by the TRONGrid API's rate limits, especially when querying exchange wallets.
- Primarily supports TRC-20 token types, with potential to add more.

Ensure you have both scripts in the same directory for full functionality. The application provides a holistic view of TRON transactions, making it a valuable asset for users interested in detailed blockchain analysis.
